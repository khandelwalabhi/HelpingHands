## Helping Hands: Makes our life easier.

### Problem Statement: 

In this hustle of busy lives and an enlarged sphere of the workplace, it is a tedious task to locate an application that truly fits in your daily life like a watch and reminds you of every micro to macro task in your daily life. To embed the seed of technology to make our life easier by introducing a simple yet powerful mobile application is the basic design principle of our application. 

### Proposed Solution :

A wholesome application to deal with all tasks not just by enlisting them rather by giving subtitles and detailed descriptions with the unique search feature. This application will not only store daily tasks like going to the gym, or maybe taking medicines rather this will also keep track of future tasks. Amidst all these tasks, one can search for upcoming important tasks which is a special ingredient of this application, user can also update and delete task as per requirement. One can give a description(detailed and briefed) as per convenience and can rely completely upon this application for reminders of the same. This application can be considered as a combination of a to-do list, a calendar, a clock manager and a reminder application.
