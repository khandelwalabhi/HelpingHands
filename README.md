## Helping Hands
### Makes our life easier.

## Problem Statement: 

In this hustle of busy lives and an enlarged sphere of the workplace, it is a tedious task to locate an application that truly fits in your daily life like a watch and reminds you of every micro to macro task in your daily life. To embed the seed of technology to make our life easier by introducing a simple yet powerful mobile application is the basic design principle of our application. 

## Proposed Solution :

A wholesome application to deal with all tasks not just by enlisting them rather by giving subtitles and detailed descriptions with the unique search feature. This application will not only store daily tasks like going to the gym, or maybe taking medicines rather this will also keep track of future tasks. Amidst all these tasks, one can search for upcoming important tasks which is a special ingredient of this application, user can also update and delete task as per requirement. One can give a description(detailed and briefed) as per convenience and can rely completely upon this application for reminders of the same. This application can be considered as a combination of a to-do list, a calendar, a clock manager and a reminder application.

## Functionality & Concepts used :

Application is simple to use. Following were the concepts used to build application with screenshot of functionalities.

* ###  Splash Screen 
A Splash Screen is a screen that appears when we open an app on our mobile device. Sometimes it's referred to as a launch screen or startup screen and shows up when our app is loading after we've just opened it. We just used a GDSC Nit Hamirpur logo in our app splash screen.

* ###  Search Screen 
User can search our task by task title in our app.

* ### Update and delete 
User can delete and update his task, He just need to swipe left & right for it. We used swipe functionality for it.

* ### Navigation library
 This App uses Navigation to switch between different screens.

* ### RecyclerView
 To present a list of the different tasks we used a custom recycler view.

* ### Spinner
 The user can select the category of task from our spinner category. Instead of writing manually user just need to select a category of task from the Spinner.

* ### LiveData, View Model & Room Database
 We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in Tasks title, description, date, time & category update it to local databases using Room. 

* ### Android Jetpack libraries
 We used android jetpack libraries in our app.

* ### View Binding
 We used view binding in our app it allows us to more easily write code that interacts with views.


## Future Scope :

This application has a vast expanse in future as we can link this application with other sources and applications. We also aim to build a sound and vibration notification as for reminding the user about tasks. This application will indeed act as a boon for students and working individuals after we link this to Google classroom, Google meet and Google calendar. By doing this application will automatically build a task of assignment from google classroom.
